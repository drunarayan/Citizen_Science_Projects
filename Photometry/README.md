# Photometry
The process of measuring the  brightness of stars is called photometry.  In this section, we will list projects that concern measuring the intrinsic brightness (energy output) of stars, the nature of light - i.e wavelength, frequency, and viariability of stars in general.  This section will also include projects relating to speckle interferometry of double stars and spectroscopic analysis of starlight.
